## BipCoin

BipCoin is a cryptonote currency and the first cryptocurrency covered by The BipCot NoGov license.
This allows use and re-use by anyone except governments and government agents. 

Unlike the GPL and other copyright-based licenses, the BipCot NoGov license uses
no government guns on violators, only shame.

BipCoin is built with love by the Beastlick Internet Policy Commission Outreach
Team. BipCoin is based on CryptoNote code, which solves the main three problems
of Bitcoin.
